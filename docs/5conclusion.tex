In summary, we are left with an important question: Are neural networks always worth all the tuning they require? Based on our findings, the answer is clearly \emph{no}. Our first use-case, numerical prediction, showed that OLS was far better suited than our neural network to predict polynomial data. 

The classification task let us see both sides: While we experienced first-hand how numerical instability and the implementation of the complex algorithms involved in machine learning can lead to hidden errors, we also saw the power of neural networks when we implemented PyTorch and were able to predict breast cancer with \textcolor{red}{(accuracy)}\% accuracy. The neural network outperformed its counterpart logistic regression, at the expense of some degree of explainability and computational time. 

We achieved our goal of exploring different usages of neural networks, and have gained more understanding and nuance about the cases in which 
It is important to tailor the methods used to the specific situation.

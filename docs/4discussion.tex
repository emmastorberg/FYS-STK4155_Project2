\subsection{Limitation of methods}
Neural networks requires vast computational resources compared to regression methods. Wee see that the runtime increases significantly for our neural net compared to our logistic regression. \\

-  Our neural nets require tuning. \\

For linear data, like in the linear regression example
%\ref{sec:linear code}
a linear regression model is a better choice. 
\\
When predicting breast cancer, we often want practitioners to use the model as decision support, not as the single source of truth. This is less straightforward with our neural network compared to the logistic regression model from scikit-learn \textcolor{red} cite, where we examined feature importance. Although prediction and understanding are related, accurate predictions can still come from flawed models, making it difficult for practitioners to interact with the model.
